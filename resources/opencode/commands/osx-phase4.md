# PHASE4: Sync Specs

Change: $1

## MANDATORY START

1. Load context:
  !`openspec-extended osx ctx get "$1"`
2. Confirm `phase` is PHASE4
3. Review `history.iterations_recorded` for previous attempts
4. Load skills: `osx-concepts` and `osx-workflow` (both reference only)

## PURPOSE

Merge delta specs from the change to main specs.

## PROCESS

1. Check for delta specs:
   - Look in `openspec/changes/$1/specs/`
   - If no delta specs exist: Skip to transition with log note

2. Load skill: Use `osc-sync-specs` (originally `openspec-sync-specs`) skill

3. Sync delta specs:
   - ADDED → Append to main spec
   - MODIFIED → Merge changes intelligently
   - REMOVED → Delete from main
   - RENAMED → Rename in main

4. Log sync summary:
   - Specs synced: <capability-list>
   - Changes: adds/modifications/removals/renames

## MANDATORY END

IF delta specs were synced:

1. Invoke osx-commit skill
2. Commit changes:

   ```bash
   git add openspec/specs/
   git commit -m "Sync $1 specs to main"
   ```

3. Record commit hash in decision log and iterations.json

## BLOCKER HANDLING

If you encounter an unrecoverable issue that prevents progress:

```bash
openspec-extended osx complete set "$1" BLOCKED --blocker-reason "[Describe the specific blocking issue]"
```

The orchestrator will detect this and halt the workflow.

**When to use:**
- Spec merge conflicts that cannot be resolved
- Main specs have been modified in ways incompatible with delta specs
- Sync would break existing functionality

## STATE FILE UPDATES

Phase complete:
```bash
openspec-extended osx state complete "$1"
```

## DECISION LOG

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx log append "$1" \
  --phase SYNC \
  --iteration N \
  --summary "Specs synced successfully" \
  --commit-hash "<hash or null>" \
  --next-steps "Proceeding to PHASE5 (SELF_REFLECTION)" \
  --extra '{"delta_specs_found":["spec1.md","spec2.md"],"sync_operations":{"added":N,"modified":N,"removed":N,"renamed":N}}'
```

## ITERATIONS.JSON

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx iterations append "$1" \
  --phase SYNC \
  --iteration N \
  --commit-hash "<hash or null>" \
  --notes "Specs synced successfully" \
  --extra '{"specs_synced":["spec1.md","spec2.md"],"operations":{"added":N,"modified":N,"removed":N,"renamed":N}}'
```

## TRANSITION

IF delta specs exist and were synced:
1. Log: "Specs synced, proceeding to ARCHIVE"
2. Mark phase complete via `osx state`
3. Script will advance to PHASE5

IF no delta specs:
1. Log: "No delta specs, skipping SYNC"
2. Mark phase complete via `osx state`
3. Script will advance to PHASE5


## SHELL ARGUMENT SAFETY

When passing free-text to `--summary`, `--next-steps`, or any other shell argument, **DO NOT use backticks** (`` `like this` ``) for inline code references. Backticks are interpreted as command substitution by bash/zsh — the shell will execute whatever is inside the backticks and substitute its output. In zsh, `` `local` `` dumps the entire shell environment (PATH, tokens, internal variables) into your string, which then gets stored verbatim in `decision-log.json`.

**Use instead:**

- Single quotes: `'local'`
- Double quotes: `"local"`
- Plain text: `local`
- Markdown `code` (which uses backticks in raw form, NOT shell backticks) — fine only when the argument is not passed through a shell

If `osx log append` returns `input_too_long` or `input_tainted`, remove the backticks from the offending argument and retry.
