# PHASE1: Implementation

Change: $1

## MANDATORY START

1. Load context:
  !`openspec-extended osx ctx get "$1"`
2. Confirm `phase` is PHASE1
3. Review `history.iterations_recorded` for previous attempts
4. Load skills: `osx-concepts` and `osx-workflow` (both reference only)
5. Read context files: `openspec/changes/$1/proposal.md`, `openspec/changes/$1/specs/`, `openspec/changes/$1/design.md`, `openspec/changes/$1/tasks.md`
6. Determine which tasks to implement this iteration

## MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: CLI Output Logging

Before beginning implementation:

1. Run: `openspec status --change "$1" --json`
2. Log via `osx log` with `cli_status` field
3. Run: `openspec instructions apply --change "$1" --json`
4. Log via `osx log` with `cli_instructions` field

## PURPOSE

Implement tasks from the change, making logical milestone commits and validating test coverage.

## PROCESS

### 1. Load Implementation Skill

Load skill: Use `osc-apply-change` (originally `openspec-apply-change`) skill for change "$1"

The skill provides the implementation workflow. Follow its task execution pattern.

### 2. Implement Tasks

Per the skill workflow:
- Read tasks.md to identify unchecked tasks
- Implement tasks sequentially
- Mark tasks complete: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Continue until all tasks complete OR iteration limit reached

### 3. MANDATORY: Milestone Commits

**You MUST commit after completing logical work units.**

- Minimum 1 commit per iteration
- Maximum 5 commits per iteration
- Subject: imperative verb + brief description (40-72 chars)
- Review staged changes: `git diff --staged` before committing

For each commit:

1. Invoke osx-commit skill
2. Stage and commit changes

**Pre-commit hook guardrails (ALWAYS apply):**
- NEVER use `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks
- If pre-commit hooks fail, fix the issues
- Re-run the commit after fixing - hooks must pass

**Persistent failures:** If fixes aren't possible within 3 attempts:
- Document the issue via `osx log`
- Consider if artifacts need modification
- May need to signal COMPLETE with blocker_reason

**Documentation scope for PHASE1:**
- ✅ Inline code comments
- ✅ README updates for new features
- ✅ Package-level doc.go files
- ✅ CLI help text and usage strings
- ❌ AGENTS.md files → Deferred to PHASE3

**Why AGENTS.md is deferred:**
AGENTS.md files document the codebase structure for future AI sessions. They should be updated AFTER all implementation is complete to ensure accurate representation of the final state. PHASE3 handles this.

### 4. Validate Test Coverage

After implementation complete:
- Run `osx-review-test-compliance` skill
- Analyze spec-to-test alignment
- IF gaps found: Implement missing tests, commit, re-run
- UNTIL: Clean or only suggestions remain

## ERROR HANDLING

- If git commit fails: Check staged files, verify working directory clean, retry once
- If tests fail repeatedly (>3 attempts): Use subagent to debug, check spec clarity
- If stuck in iteration loop (>3 iterations with no progress): Document blocker, signal COMPLETE
- If openspec CLI commands fail: Proceed without CLI output, document via `osx log`

## BLOCKER HANDLING

If you encounter an unrecoverable issue that prevents progress:

```bash
openspec-extended osx complete set "$1" BLOCKED --blocker-reason "[Describe the specific blocking issue]"
```

The orchestrator will detect this and halt the workflow.

**When to use:**
- Pre-commit hook failures that cannot be resolved after 3 attempts
- Implementation fundamentally blocked by unclear or contradictory specs
- External dependencies unavailable or broken
- Task cannot be completed due to missing information

## STATE FILE UPDATES

When all tasks are complete:
```bash
openspec-extended osx state complete "$1"
```

## DECISION LOG

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx log append "$1" \
  --phase IMPLEMENTATION \
  --iteration N \
  --summary "What was accomplished this iteration" \
  --next-steps "Continue implementation or transition to PHASE2" \
  --errors '[]' \
  --extra '{"assumptions":["Assumption with rationale"],"tasks_completed":["1.1","1.2"],"tasks_remaining":0,"commits_made":N,"cli_status":{},"cli_instructions":{}}'
```

## ITERATIONS.JSON

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx iterations append "$1" \
  --phase IMPLEMENTATION \
  --iteration N \
  --notes "Brief summary" \
  --errors '[]' \
  --extra '{"tasks_completed":["1.1","1.2","1.3"],"tasks_remaining":0,"tasks_this_session":3,"commits_made":N,"cli_status":{},"cli_instructions":{}}'
```

## TRANSITION

When all tasks in `tasks.md` are marked complete `[x]`:
- Log: "All tasks complete, transitioning to PHASE2 (REVIEW)"
- Mark phase complete via `osx state`
- Script will advance to PHASE2

Note: AGENTS.md updates will occur in PHASE3 (MAINTAIN DOCS), not here. Even if tasks.md contains AGENTS.md tasks, they should be deferred to PHASE3.


## SHELL ARGUMENT SAFETY

When passing free-text to `--summary`, `--next-steps`, or any other shell argument, **DO NOT use backticks** (`` `like this` ``) for inline code references. Backticks are interpreted as command substitution by bash/zsh — the shell will execute whatever is inside the backticks and substitute its output. In zsh, `` `local` `` dumps the entire shell environment (PATH, tokens, internal variables) into your string, which then gets stored verbatim in `decision-log.json`.

**Use instead:**

- Single quotes: `'local'`
- Double quotes: `"local"`
- Plain text: `local`
- Markdown `code` (which uses backticks in raw form, NOT shell backticks) — fine only when the argument is not passed through a shell

If `osx log append` returns `input_too_long` or `input_tainted`, remove the backticks from the offending argument and retry.
