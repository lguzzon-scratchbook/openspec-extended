# PHASE0: Artifact Review

Change: $1

## MANDATORY START

1. Load context:
  !`openspec-extended osx ctx get "$1"`
2. Confirm `phase` is PHASE0
3. Review `history.iterations_recorded` for previous attempts
4. Load skills: `osx-concepts` and `osx-workflow` (both reference only)

## PURPOSE

Ensure OpenSpec artifacts are excellent before implementation. Validate:
- Format (required sections, correct headers, checkbox syntax)
- Content quality (specificity, SHALL/MUST usage, clarity)
- Implementation readiness (dependencies, scope achievability, task specificity)
- Cross-artifact consistency (proposal→specs, specs→design, design→tasks)

## PROCESS

1. Load and use `osx-review-artifacts` skill for change "$1"
2. Execute review instructions from the skill
3. Review findings:
   - **CRITICAL**: Must fix before implementation (blocks progress)
   - **WARNING**: Should fix, may cause issues during implementation
   - **SUGGESTION**: Nice to have, non-blocking

4. IF CRITICAL or WARNING issues found:
    **YOU MUST FIX THEM IMMEDIATELY IN THIS SAME INVOCATION - DO NOT WAIT FOR NEXT ITERATION**
    a. For each issue, use `osx-modify-artifacts` skill to fix it NOW
    b. Track iteration via `osx log` and `osx iterations`
    c. After fixing all CRITICAL/WARNING issues, re-run review to verify fixes
    d. Only report "Recommendation: Fix issues" if you are UNABLE to fix them

5. IF CLEAN (no CRITICAL or WARNING issues):
    a. Log completion via `osx log`
    b. Mark phase complete via `osx state`
    c. Script will advance to PHASE1

6. IF MAX ITERATIONS (10) reached without clean review:
    a. Document all remaining CRITICAL issues via `osx log`
   b. Create `complete.json` with BLOCKED status (workflow stops)

## MANDATORY END

IF artifacts were modified during this phase:

1. Invoke osx-commit skill
2. Commit changes:

   ```bash
   git add openspec/changes/$1/
   git commit -m "Review and iterate artifacts for $1"
   ```

3. Record commit hash in decision log

## STATE FILE UPDATES

Phase complete (clean review):
```bash
openspec-extended osx state complete "$1"
```

Critical blocker (cannot proceed):
```bash
openspec-extended osx complete set "$1" BLOCKED --blocker-reason "[Describe the blocking issue]"
```

## DECISION LOG

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx log append "$1" \
  --phase ARTIFACT_REVIEW \
  --iteration N \
  --summary "Brief summary of this iteration" \
  --commit-hash "<hash or null>" \
  --next-steps "Proceed to PHASE1 or continue review" \
  --issues '{"critical":N,"warning":N,"suggestion":N}' \
  --artifacts-modified '["proposal.md","specs/auth.md"]' \
  --extra '{"issues_fixed":{"critical":N,"warning":N,"suggestion":N}}'
```

## ITERATIONS.JSON

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx iterations append "$1" \
  --phase ARTIFACT_REVIEW \
  --iteration N \
  --commit-hash "<hash or null>" \
  --notes "Brief summary" \
  --extra '{"artifacts_reviewed":["proposal","specs","design","tasks"],"issues_found":{"critical":N,"warning":N,"suggestion":N},"issues_fixed":{"critical":N,"warning":N,"suggestion":N}}'
```

## GUARDRAILS

- Must fix CRITICAL issues before proceeding
- Max 10 review iterations
- One commit at end of phase if artifacts were modified
- Early exit if first review returns clean


## SHELL ARGUMENT SAFETY

When passing free-text to `--summary`, `--next-steps`, or any other shell argument, **DO NOT use backticks** (`` `like this` ``) for inline code references. Backticks are interpreted as command substitution by bash/zsh — the shell will execute whatever is inside the backticks and substitute its output. In zsh, `` `local` `` dumps the entire shell environment (PATH, tokens, internal variables) into your string, which then gets stored verbatim in `decision-log.json`.

**Use instead:**

- Single quotes: `'local'`
- Double quotes: `"local"`
- Plain text: `local`
- Markdown `code` (which uses backticks in raw form, NOT shell backticks) — fine only when the argument is not passed through a shell

If `osx log append` returns `input_too_long` or `input_tainted`, remove the backticks from the offending argument and retry.
