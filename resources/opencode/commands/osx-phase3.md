## Tools Available

| Tool | Usage |

| Domains: `ctx`, `state`, `iterations`, `log`, `complete`, `validate` |

# PHASE3: Maintain Documentation

Change: $1

## MANDATORY START

1. Load context:
  !`openspec-extended osx ctx get "$1"`
2. Confirm `phase` is PHASE3
3. Review `history.iterations_recorded` for previous attempts
4. Load skills: `osx-concepts` and `osx-workflow` (both reference only)

## PURPOSE

Update AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md files to reflect ALL changes made during implementation. If there is an available skill for that process, load it first.

**Scope - What to update:**
- Root AGENTS.md with new commands, patterns, or conventions
- Package-level AGENTS.md files (e.g., `internal/library/AGENTS.md`)
- CLAUDE.md if project supports both platforms
- Any other AI context documentation

**What to include:**
- New packages and their purpose
- New CLI commands and usage
- New architectural patterns
- Updated command references
- New capabilities added to the codebase

**NOT in scope:**
- Inline code comments (done in PHASE1)
- README files (done in PHASE1)
- Test files (done in PHASE1)

## PROCESS

1. Load and use `osx-maintain-ai-docs` skill
2. Read change artifacts: `openspec/changes/$1/proposal.md`, `openspec/changes/$1/specs/`, `openspec/changes/$1/design.md`, `openspec/changes/$1/tasks.md`
3. Read recent git changes: `git log --oneline -10`
4. Update project documentation:
   - AGENTS.md - Update with new commands, patterns, or conventions
   - CLAUDE.md - Update if Claude-specific patterns changed (if applicable)
   - Other docs as needed based on the change

5. Apply best practices:
   - Use tables over verbose lists
   - Be specific (concrete commands, not vague descriptions)
   - Progressive disclosure (summary first, details later)
   - Target <300 lines per file

## AGENTS.md TASKS FROM TASKS.MD

If tasks.md contains AGENTS.md documentation tasks (e.g., "12.1 Update cmd/AGENTS.md"):

1. These tasks were intentionally deferred from PHASE1
2. Complete them now as part of this phase
3. Mark them complete in tasks.md after updating
4. Include in the single PHASE3 commit

This consolidation ensures:
- Single documentation commit for review
- Accurate representation of final codebase state
- No duplicate documentation work

## MANDATORY END

IF documentation was updated during this phase:

1. Invoke osx-commit skill
2. Commit changes:

   ```bash
   git add AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
   git commit -m "Update documentation for $1"
   ```

3. Record commit hash in decision log and iterations.json

## BLOCKER HANDLING

If you encounter an unrecoverable issue that prevents progress:

```bash
openspec-extended osx complete set "$1" BLOCKED --blocker-reason "[Describe the specific blocking issue]"
```

The orchestrator will detect this and halt the workflow.

**When to use:**
- Documentation conflicts that cannot be resolved
- AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md structure fundamentally incompatible with changes

## STATE FILE UPDATES

Phase complete:
```bash
openspec-extended osx state complete "$1"
```

## DECISION LOG

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx log append "$1" \
  --phase MAINTAIN_DOCS \
  --iteration N \
  --summary "Documentation updated successfully" \
  --commit-hash "<hash or null>" \
  --next-steps "Proceeding to PHASE4 (SYNC)" \
  --extra '{"docs_updated":["AGENTS.md","CLAUDE.md"],"changes_made":["Specific change 1","Specific change 2"]}'
```

## ITERATIONS.JSON

Append entry:
```bash
openspec-extended osx iterations append "$1" \
  --phase MAINTAIN_DOCS \
  --iteration N \
  --commit-hash "<hash or null>" \
  --notes "Documentation updated successfully" \
  --extra '{"docs_updated":["AGENTS.md","CLAUDE.md"]}'
```

## TRANSITION

1. Log: "Documentation updated, proceeding to SYNC"
2. Mark phase complete via `osx state`
3. Script will advance to PHASE4


## SHELL ARGUMENT SAFETY

When passing free-text to `--summary`, `--next-steps`, or any other shell argument, **DO NOT use backticks** (`` `like this` ``) for inline code references. Backticks are interpreted as command substitution by bash/zsh — the shell will execute whatever is inside the backticks and substitute its output. In zsh, `` `local` `` dumps the entire shell environment (PATH, tokens, internal variables) into your string, which then gets stored verbatim in `decision-log.json`.

**Use instead:**

- Single quotes: `'local'`
- Double quotes: `"local"`
- Plain text: `local`
- Markdown `code` (which uses backticks in raw form, NOT shell backticks) — fine only when the argument is not passed through a shell

If `osx log append` returns `input_too_long` or `input_tainted`, remove the backticks from the offending argument and retry.
